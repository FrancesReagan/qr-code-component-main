My Process: 
  I collaborated with our teacher and students for baseline HTML and CSS; as well as using Figma and Figma plug-in "GreatFrontEnd" to retrieve exacting HTML and
  CSS code for the design and its components.
  *Built with: 
  - Semantic HTML5 markup
  - CSS custom properties
  - Flexbox
  - CSS Grid
  -Figma with plugin "GreatFront End"

What I learned:
  Collaboration is a more fun way to learn to code; stressing out and trying to learn or overcome problems in isolation has been a real road-blocker for me until I 
  really leaned into helping and being helped by my teammates in the breakout rooms or in the main zoom classroom with our Per Scholas teacher, Abraham E. Taverez.
  I learned how to utilize Figma and VS code together to closely replicate the design given. I have more learning to do and some knowledge gaps, yet I am learning that
  you don't need to know it all you just need to ask questions and work together.
